00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,080
hi everyone welcome to the second part

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,399
of our Solana development walkthrough

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,600
series

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,240
in this video we'll be going over how to

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,920
use the very powerful

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,440
spl-token command line interface

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
in order to do so and get the most out

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
of it we'll first of all install the

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,039
dependencies

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,080
set up our Solana local environment then

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,640
create

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
tokens learn how to properly use them

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,359
and finally create a digital

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
non-fungible token

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
and use them likewise

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
this tutorial will require you to have a

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,840
proper rustup

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,399
rustc and cargo installation in your

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,280
environment

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
as well as the Solana command line

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
interface and

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
the spl-token package both of which

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
we'll be going over on more details

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
throughout this video

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
as always if more resources are needed

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
you can count on Solana's official

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
documentation

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,760
as well as the Github repositories which

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
are well documented

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,799
and for more personalized support don't

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,960
hesitate to join the Solana official

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,320
discord

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
so fellow developer let's get to work

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
the token subsection

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
of the Solana program library already

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
contains a very detailed walkthrough on

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,320
what you need to set up

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,799
and run in order to implement both

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,520
fungible

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,000
and non-vulnerable tokens this is made

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,280
incredibly easy

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
thanks to the Solana core developers

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,960
they've already gone through

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,439
all the trouble of writing program and

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,200
also releasing other bindings

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
in which you can use both for C and

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
Cavascript but for this tutorial

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,640
we're sticking with rust the first

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,079
command we'll need to do

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,040
is a simple cargo install spl-token-cli

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
(command line interface)

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
this command has a lot of dependencies

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
so you can brace yourself for some

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
waiting

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
but cargo should be able to download and

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,000
compile

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
every single requirement if it doesn't

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
please check both

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
your cargo and rust installations or

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,319
reach out to us

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,840
on discord the spl-token package we just

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,720
installed

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
shares configurations with the Solana

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,239
command line interface

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
we can check that by running Solana

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,599
config

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
get to get an error message please check

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,440
your salon

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,239
installation or your environment

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,360
configuration

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
if you need to install the command line

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
interface all you need to do

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,319
is run this curl then shell

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,959
installation

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
this message right here should indicate

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,000
to us

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
that the installation went properly to

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
add the salona binaries

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,959
to your environment path you can just

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,239
run this other

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,640
export command after that we can check

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
if our command line interface is working

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
by running Solana --version so

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,159
now we can proceed with the token

85
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,239
going back to our token program we'll

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,280
check the current

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,239
configurations

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
as you can see by default we're using

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
the mainnet

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
to change that we can just change our

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,760
configuration

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,440
by running Solana config

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
set --url and

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
pointing towards the devnet this will

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
print out the updated configurations

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
for our next step we'll need the Solana

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,519
wallet

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
there are many methods for you to do

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
this either

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
via hardware your wallet or paper wallet

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
but in our case i'm going to show you

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
how you can create a file system wallet

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,080
associated with the local

104
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
.json file so we'll run the following

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,640
command

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,080
which will output to this directory

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,959
the my-keypair.json the command will

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
prompt us a passphrase

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
and this password is only applied to our

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
recovered seed phrase

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,439
so I'll choose anything and keep in mind

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,480
that right now

113
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,599
we have our key pair json and

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,920
all info contained here is totally

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
unencrypted

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
so do not share this with anyone

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
but what you can share with everyone is

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
your public key and

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
in order to get that we run the Solana

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
keygen pub key command

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
with our file system wallets in hand we

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
can point the configuration key pair

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,320
to the newly created my-keypair.json

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
by running the config set command once

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
again with the --keypair flag

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
and this should do it for the initial

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
setup simple as that

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
right now we can use the cargo spl-token

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
package we just installed

130
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
and run the spl-token create token

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,080
command

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
if you get this message it means that we

133
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,560
do not have

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
enough funds in a wallet in order to

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,840
create the

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
token what's nice here is that our

137
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,680
Solana

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
common line interface already has an

139
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
airdrop feature built into it

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
so we can just write solana airdrop

141
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
the amount of tokens we're requesting

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,479
our

143
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,440
public key address which is right here

144
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
and then we need to point the url to our

145
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,639
devnet

146
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
endpoint and there we go we now have 10

147
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,880
SOL tokens

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
we can once again run the spl-token

149
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,400
create command

150
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
and it should succeed we can check our

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
supply by running the command as spl-

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
token supply

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
and pointing it to our token address

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,960
by default it's zero so we now

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,479
will need to mint some tokens for that

156
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,120
we'll create a new account associated

157
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
with our

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
main token by running the command

159
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
spl-token create account

160
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
and give it our address this account

161
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
will hold

162
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
the minted tokens as usual

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,840
this account will have no balance by

164
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,400
default

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
but let's change that by running as spl-

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
token mint the address of our original

167
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,800
token and the amount that we want to

168
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
mint

169
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
so yeah it succeeded if we check

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
the supply of our newly created token

171
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
we can see that we now have a hundred

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
new tokens created

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
and likewise if we check the balance

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,319
of our recipient address

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,280
we'll see that

176
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
it's received 100 tokens

177
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,800
now if we want to expand our token into

178
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,759
other accounts

179
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,639
we'll of course need another Solana

180
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,520
wallet

181
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,840
and we can just generate another one by

182
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,479
using

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
the same command that we used before

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,759
then

185
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
we can just once again set

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
our configuration here but point it to

187
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
the other key pair that we have

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
and run the same command to create an

189
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,560
account

190
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
with the original token address once

191
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
again

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
we'll need some funds in order to do

193
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
that so

194
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
there we go now we've created another

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
account associated with

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
our initial Solana token another really

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
cool feature

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
of the library is that we can use spl-

199
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,639
token

200
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,639
wrap and specify the amount

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,240
of SOL tokens that we want to associate

202
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,720
with

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
our creative token and this basically

204
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,199
allows us to expand

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,919
the functionality and usability of the

206
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,879
SOL token

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,520
into the spl-token library so we can

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
treat it

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
as any other spl-token

210
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
would be treated and this really helps

211
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,639
you out

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
after wrapping our token we can use once

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,080
again

214
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,759
the spl-token

215
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
account command to check that

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
we now have another account here that's

217
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,519
running that has almost exactly one

218
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,958
SOL token as a balance and if we want

219
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
to change it back

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
we just need to do the inverse process

221
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,160
we'll need to copy the account address

222
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
that we ended up creating

223
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
with the wrap command and just use

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,640
spl-token

225
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,959
unwrap

226
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
there we go if we check our accounts

227
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
once again

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
the former SOL wrapped token is gone

229
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
now remember that other account that we

230
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,880
created

231
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,920
let's check it out once again by running

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Solana config set

233
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,920
key pair and point it to the other

234
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
keypair

235
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,240
that we have as expected it doesn't have

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,800
any of our created tokens let's change

237
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,279
that

238
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,800
let's use our minted account here that

239
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,839
we have

240
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,480
and run the new spl-token

241
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,080
transfer command and also the first address

242
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
that we pass on is not from the original

243
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,880
token

244
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,120
but from the account associated with the

245
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,399
minting process

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
so let's use the same command pass on

247
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
our original account the amount of

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
tokens that we need

249
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,160
to transfer and the receiver

250
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
address

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
right now if you once again run Solana

252
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,079
config set

253
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,279
to switch back to the receiver address

254
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,839
we can check that

255
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,240
we now have 42 tokens that we created

256
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
and sent it directly to our other user

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
now remember the second wallet that we

258
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,560
created the receiver had to manually

259
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
associate an address in order to receive

260
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
our newly created token

261
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,399
and this is a bit of a hassle because in

262
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,079
the real world scenario

263
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
people won't actually do that especially

264
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
if your token is new

265
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
so there is an option called fund

266
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,079
recipient

267
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,680
which the sender him or herself can fund

268
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,079
for

269
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,079
the account creation and also for the

270
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,200
transaction

271
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,839
so in order to do that we generate a new

272
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,320
key

273
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
pair for our file system wallet

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
right now i'm going to airdrop some

275
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
tokens into our newly created account

276
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,200
if we skip this part then the Solana

277
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
command line interface

278
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
is going to tell us that this address

279
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,240
does not exist and

280
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
this is not specifically necessary you

281
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,279
just

282
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,760
have to interact with the devnet in

283
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,959
order for it to

284
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,240
commit that the newly created address

285
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
exists so we can revert our

286
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,519
configurations

287
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,640
back to our original token minter

288
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,600
and we should be good to go to use the

289
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,000
new

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,800
fund recipient option spl-token

291
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,519
transfer fund

292
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,040
recipient and

293
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
oh one thing to note we need our

294
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,880
address still so spl

295
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,480
token account

296
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
we need the account itself in order to

297
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
use this command

298
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
so this is going to be it let's not

299
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,639
forget the amount of tokens that we're

300
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,440
transferring

301
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,399
in this case it will be 8 and we can

302
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,440
just

303
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,600
copy the Solana address itself

304
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,079
if we check out

305
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,600
our account here you see that

306
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,160
we did receive the tokens without having

307
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,800
to pay

308
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,000
any fees for that creating an nft

309
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,279
or a digital non-fungible token is

310
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,079
really similar to what we've done so far

311
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,720
but

312
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,760
instead of having the ability to mint

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,279
multiple tokens we'll cap the minting

314
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
at one so our token is unique

315
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
and also has all the other features of

316
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,519
an

317
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,399
ERC-20 like token like transferring

318
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,360
ownership

319
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,560
and so on so first of all let's create a

320
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
new account

321
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,079
by running Solana kegen

322
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,800
new and output it to our

323
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,480
nft key pair file

324
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
point our configurations towards it

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
airdrop some SOL tokens

326
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,279
from devnet

327
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
and we're good to create another token

328
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
let's associate an account to it so we

329
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
can mint tokens

330
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,079
and finally mint only a single token

331
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,480
since we're the master account

332
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
associated with this token we can

333
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
disable the minting by

334
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,839
running spl-token authorize

335
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
the address of the token itself and mint

336
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,639
with the flag disabled and that's it

337
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,639
if we check the accounts that we have

338
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
you'll see that we have only a single

339
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
minted token

340
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,079
and if we check the supply

341
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
of our token

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,360
you'll see that it stayed stably one

343
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,639
if the owner wants to transfer the nft

344
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,720
he or she can do it using the same

345
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
commands that we've been using so far

346
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,959
so let's do it spl

347
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,000
token transfer let's use also

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
the kind of mandatory in this case

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,800
fund recipient options so the

350
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,399
transaction is done

351
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,079
we will need to point our configurations

352
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
back to the origin to the receiver

353
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
and if we do spl

354
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,760
token account

355
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,920
we'll see that we now have the nft

356
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
really simple and intuitive so this is

357
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
going to wrap up

358
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,199
another one of our Solana development
